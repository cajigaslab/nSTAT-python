## Summary

| Section | Mapped | Partial | Missing | Not Applicable |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `public api` | 18 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| `help workflows` | 34 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `paper examples` | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `docs gallery` | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `installer setup` | 4 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| `repo structure` | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

## Coverage Notes

- Public API: no missing MATLAB public APIs remain; only the MATLAB help-browser utility is explicitly non-applicable.
- Help/notebook parity: all inventoried MATLAB help workflows are mapped to Python notebooks or equivalents.
- Paper examples and docs gallery: all canonical paper examples and committed gallery directories are mapped.

## Remaining Deltas

No partial or missing items remain.

## Justified Non-Applicable Items

- `public_api`: `nstatOpenHelpPage`. MATLAB help-browser integration does not have a direct Python equivalent.
- `installer_setup`: `CleanUserPathPrefs option`. Accepted as a compatibility no-op because Python does not use MATLAB-style saved user path preferences.
- `installer_setup`: `MATLAB runtime path pruning`. Python packaging/import resolution replaces MATLAB path management.
- `installer_setup`: `MATLAB toolbox cache refresh and savepath`. There is no Python equivalent to MATLAB toolbox cache refresh or savepath persistence.
